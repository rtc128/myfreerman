.SH DESCRIPTION

This is a tool that wraps MySQL Enterprise Backup to handle backups of MySQL databases.

It adds support for:

- Listing full and binlog bakcups

- Compressing binlog backups

- Restoring only a schema / only a list of tables

- Automated PITR

- Recovery window maintenance

- Creating a new database directory structure

.SH CONFIGURATION

The default configuration section is \fBmysqld\fR for the server and \fBmyfreerman\fR for myfreerman. You can define environment variable \fBMYSQL_SID\fR to change the section.
Exemple: MYSQL_SID=dev => sections are mysqld@dev and myfreerman@dev.

.SH OPTIONS

-c Use another configuration file, and not the default /etc/my.cnf.

-l Print output to log file. Variables in format are the same as in "date" command.

-q Quiet mode - do not show release information


.B backup

Backup the database. The new backup can be \fBfull\fR or \fBbinlog\fR backup.

	full: database full backup

	binlog: backup binary logs


.B init

Create a new server repository - according to MySQL configuration parameters.

.B list

List current backups. List \fBfull\fR or \fBbinlog\fR backups.

	-r List backups from remote mysql server.

.B restore

Restore a previously created backup.
By default, after restoring a backup with PITR, a new backup incarnation is created. Directories $BACKUP_DIR/base and $BACKUP_DIR/binlog are moved to $BACKUP_DIR/restore/$CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.
If you anytime wish to access this backupset again, you need to manually move contents from $BACKUP_DIR/restore/$CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to $BACKUP_DIR. See -n option.
Server config file must exist.

   -f Use specified backup directory to restore database from, and not the one in configuration file.

   -n Do not create a new backup incarnation. This is used for PITR accross different environments, such as restoring production backups in test servers.

   -p Restore using a specific point in time - PITR.

   -d Restore only a specific schema. Cannot be used with -t.

   -x Restore only a specific schema, but with a new name. Requires -d.

   -t Restore only specific table(s). Cannot be used with -d.

   -s Slave mode: do not apply binlogs after restoration. Needed when mounting a slave server.
   
   -y Assume YES to confirmation.
